Great Bay--a CLI eBay knockoff!

This is a node-based program where the user will initiate the program in their CLI and then can post an item to the database or bid on an item.  The user will be able to bid on items they post to the database as well.  If the user enters the highest bid then they will up the price on the item and be the current highest bidder.  If they bid too low then they will be prompted for a higher bid to win.

The program queries a MySQL database with a node server.  The inquirer NPM package is used to prompt the user to make an action.
