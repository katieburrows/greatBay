Great Bay--a knockoff of eBay!

A node-based program where the user will initiate the program in their CLI and then can post an item to the database or bid.  The user will be able to bid on items they post to the database as well.  If the user enters the highest bid then they will up the price on the item.  If they bid too low then they will be prompted for a higher bid to win.
